Welcome to our project of Parrarel Distributed Computing

How to run the file:

1.Run the command on you terminal to complile the bash script file:
 chmod +x driver.sh

2.Now as the file has been compiled an executale has been made as:
 driver.sh

3.To run the executable type:
 ./driver.sh

Now the program is running make sure to enter the commands that display on
the terminal after executing only after teh GUI is printed otherwise the program
may crash

The bashscript upon executing first compiles the C code and then 
one by one executes for each file.

IMPORTANT 
Make sure that all the graph files are in your directory where the code is.
Also you need to make sure that the path of the directory is correct which
you can change according to your needs
The path is stated in the top line of the bash script

Thats All :)
